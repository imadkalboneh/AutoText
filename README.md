<h2>Python</h2>
I've used version 3.5.7 to write the script used here in the WebContent/refs folder. If it works in a later version you've already installed, cheers! If not, go to <a href='https://www.python.org/downloads/'>this link</a> and look for v3.5.7 and follow the installation process. <br><br>NOTE: add python to your environment variables. It'll allow you to use the <i>python</i> command in your command line!

<h2>Selenium</h2>
All you need here is a command line terminal, and you need to be an admin. Run the following commands: <br>
<ol>
	<li>You'll first need to install <i>python pip</i>. Ignore this step if you already have it installed.<br>
	<i>python get-pip.py</i></li><br>
	<li>Now that you definitely have <i>pip</i>, download selenium<br>
	<i>pip install selenium</i></li>
</ol>
